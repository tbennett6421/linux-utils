HOWTO: create custom fortune cookies files
Open your favourite editor and add the strings that you want to be shown when running "fortune" in terminal. BE SURE to add a single line with a letter % in it, between every string.
Save this file to whatever file name you want; this guide uses "yourlist" as example.
When done adding strings, run the command "strfile -c % yourlist yourlist.dat". This will create a .dat file for your cookie file, which contains a header structure and a table of file offsets for each group of lines. This allows random access of the strings.
Run "fortune yourlist" to eat the fruit of your work. That's it! 
If you want this cookie file to appear as any other of the standard fortune cookies (when simply running "fortune"), just add your string file and .dat file into "/usr/share/games/fortunes/".
Oh, and one more thing: if you want to change anything in "yourfile", you will need to repeat this HOWTO again for it to work.

Good luck!
